## Dataset description
Every year, the United States Census Bureau collects two datasets released to the public. We will be using the personal dataset from USA to collect information about education, occupation, disabilities, insurance, and location.  

__Datasets are from Link to Data__: www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2015/1-Year/csv_pus.zip

__Data Dictionary__: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/PUMS_Data_Dictionary_2011-2015.pdf


## Project Proposal
In the recent election, we have learned that America is heavily divided by location and income. Thus in this project, we wanted create a database that will view individual Americans. We focused on how does your location/education/disability, affect your job? By using 2015 US population data from United States Census Bureau, we are able to create a relationship that demonstrates a person's life in America. We hope to use this application to see how different aspect of your life affect their future for a career or retirement. How many people are in a field they majored in. Moreover, we aspire to determine how much minorities(such as disability, or ethnic) are affected compared to the majority.

We will do the web design option.
