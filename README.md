## What our Database application is doing(proposal)?
  We are creating a "mapping people" application which is intended to map people's behaviors and everyday life. We are connecting several aspects of everyday life suhc as job/industry, educational level, and wheather they flush the toilet or not. Connecting this with aspects such as when they arrive to work, what major they had in college, and where they are from we would try to accomplish a borader sense of ***********.

## Expanation of the project:
  *plan of how we will expand this project in part 3(otherwise, must do a front-end dev):
     i. Figure out how to make a relationship set on Household(?) and connect it to personal somehow(?)
     ii. Think of where people buy their clothes (try to think of a way to link socio-economic status to location or another aspect)
